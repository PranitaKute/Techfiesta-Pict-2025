# AI-Based Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial fraud is a major challenge for banks and digital payment systems. Every year, financial institutions lose huge amounts of money due to fraudulent transactions.

Most traditional fraud detection systems are rule-based, which means:

- Fraud is often detected after the loss  
- Many genuine transactions are incorrectly blocked (high false positives)  
- Decisions are hard to explain to users or auditors  

---

## ✅ Our Approach

To solve this problem, we designed an adaptive AI-based fraud detection system that works in real time and focuses on risk assessment instead of yes/no decisions.

Our system:

- Generates a risk score for every transaction  
- Uses both machine learning and anomaly detection  
- Provides clear explanations for every decision  
- Helps in taking smarter and faster actions on transactions

## 🚀 Key Features

- Risk-Based Fraud Scoring instead of binary labels  
- Hybrid AI Model  
  - Random Forest for known fraud patterns  
  - Autoencoder for detecting unusual or unknown behavior  
- Explainable AI Outputs for transparency  
- Real-Time Transaction Simulation  
- Scalable and Cloud-Ready Design

## 📊 Dataset Strategy

- Transaction data is designed based on real-world banking behavior  
- Synthetic data is generated to handle rare and edge fraud cases  
- Data leakage features are removed to ensure fair evaluation  
- In real deployment, the model can be trained using actual bank transaction logs

🔍 Explainability

To ensure trust and transparency, the system explains every fraud decision using:

Behaviour-based anomaly scores

Model-generated risk probabilities

Simple, human-readable reasons

Recommended actions such as Allow / OTP / Block

🔐 Ethics & Security Considerations

No personal or sensitive user data is exposed

All risk decisions are explainable

Designed to minimize bias and reduce false positives

Secure and controlled model execution

🔮 Future Enhancements

Real-time transaction streaming using Kafka

Microservices using FastAPI

Full cloud deployment

Automated model retraining pipelines

Role-based dashboards for banks and admins
